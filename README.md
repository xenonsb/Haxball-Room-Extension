# Haxball All-in-one Tool

**Side note**: I haven't been that active with updates lately, but hopefully I can push some semi-frequent updates :) - August 2020

To do so, download all the files within this repository into a folder, and follow the instructions at [https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/) to locate manifest.json.

**Chrome Web Store**: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oobhbkpciiodddpiaknpdhccmdjnlkde](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oobhbkpciiodddpiaknpdhccmdjnlkde)

**Firefox Addons**: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/haxball-all-in-one-tool/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/haxball-all-in-one-tool/)

**New in version 0.3.8**: Right click to tag! Within chat log, you can right click someone's chat message to @Mention them. Also, you can also right click their name from the room player view to @Mention them.

**New in version 0.3.4**: New options page and text expansion macros! In light of the bot-hosted rooms nowadays with a bunch of commands, why not have text expansions? For instance, if you constantly need to type "!admin" to chat, you can assign it as ".ad" and that will automatically expand to "!admin". Also, I've made a few fixes to the record shortcut (press R to record) and improved the add-on settings changes in-game. To configure text shortcuts, go to the add-on options and press configure shortcuts.

**New in version 0.3.1**: due to mis-use of kick/ban shortcuts, they're now set to double-click. Also, chat transparency is now user-customizable - enjoy! There's also a hidden feature baked in this update.. can you find it? :D (ok it's press R in-game to record replay, simple!)

**New in version 0.3.0**: fixed the chat hide toggle key to the key under ESC! No matter what keyboard layout you are, just find the key right below ESC!

**New in version 0.2.4**: added hotkeys to access other camera views (press 5, 6, 7, or 8 while in-game), links in chat will now be "clickable" hyperlinks that open in a new tab, minor fixes to hiding chat

**New in version 0.2.2**: overhaul of add-on settings in the nickname selection page, also the option to hide chat completely (not just transparency!) The chat toggle is at the top (game goals/time bar). When chat is hidden, you can still use the "Tab" key to quickly access chat. In addition, use the top left key of your keyboard (~ or ") to quickly show/hide the chat area.

**New in version 0.1.9**: woohoo, transparent chat! Who doesn't want more screen estate to see more of the field?

**New in version 0.1.6**: multiple search term for rooms! In case you want to look at your several favourite rooms at once, separate your search terms (as many as you want) using +. For instance, let's say you want to look for spacebounce rooms and soccer rooms at the same time. Type in the search term "spacebounce+soccer" and you'll have it! Refer to the screenshot below for an example.

For use on HTML5 version of [http://haxball.com](http://haxball.com). This extension asks for permission to store information on your computer to keep track of your selection for which tool to enable, and also your most recent room search term.

Haxball All-in-one Tool adds a few time-saving features to the existing HTML5 version of the game. It works with all rooms hosted on the HTML5 game!

**✓ Room Search (original idea by Raamyy)**: quickly filter rooms by their room names (or partial room names) using the search bar above the room list. Also, if you would like to have more than 1 search term, simply separate it with a +. Partial room name match will work even with +.

| :--: |
| Search rooms by room name (exact or partial), with search terms separated by +, with extra button to auto-join rooms |

**✓ Auto Join**: trying to join a full room? Select any room in the list and click Auto Join - it does the refreshing for you and clicks in the moment a slot is free

**✓ Admin Kick/Ban shortcuts**: having difficulties kicking or banning abusive users quickly? If you are an admin of the room, click ESC in the room player list view to add the [K]ick and [B]an buttons. One click operation to kick/ban any player :) (of course not the host)

| ![](/screenshots/ss3.png) |
| :--: |
| One-click buttons to [K]ick and [B]an - usable for room admins only! |

**✓ Local mute**: don't want to see a certain player's messages? Simply right click their name and press the mute button!

| Local mute button - right click a player to mute them from chat! |

**✓ (Beta) Notification when you're moved into a team**: forgot to check the Haxball tab? You'll get a desktop notification when you are moved into a team. Be aware that this is still a beta function!

**✓ Transparent chat**: want to see chat but also see more of the field? You now have it :D Credits to P a c i f i c for helping with the implementation :)

**✓ Hide chat toggle**: if you really want to focus on the game without the transparent chat log, now you have it! Press the hide chat toggle on the score/time bar (or using the ~ key or " key on the top left of your keyboard), and it'll show/hide your chat :) But if you still need to chat quickly, just press "Tab" and chat normally

**✓ Other camera views**: maybe 1.5x zoom isn't enough for you, feel free to use anything from 1.75X onwards by using the hotkeys 5, 6, 7, or 8 in-game

**✓ Link formatted in chat**: it is now easier to click on links sent by other players through chat

**✓ Record hotkey R**: when in game or in a lobby, press R to begin/stop recording

**✓ Text expansion macros**: for quicker typing of constantly used commands/terms, you can now do so! The options for this is tucked into the add-on settings, or can be accessed through extension menu/add-ons menu under options/preferences.
